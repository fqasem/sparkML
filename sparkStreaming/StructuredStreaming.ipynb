    "## Leveraging Apache Spark for Smart Building HVAC Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the distributed architecture of Spark in the context of smart building monitoring\n",
    "- Simulate real-time sensor data for HVAC systems in a building\n",
    "- Perform SQL queries to detect critical environmental conditions and calculate average readings\n",
    "- Determine the aggregated results to the console for immediate insights into room conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Smart Building Solutions, Inc. specializes in optimizing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems to enhance comfort and energy efficiency in commercial buildings. By monitoring temperature and humidity levels in real-time across various rooms, the company aims to ensure optimal indoor conditions and preemptively address potential HVAC issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a continuous influx of sensor data, Smart Building Solutions needs to process and analyze this data in real-time to maintain the quality of the indoor environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set description\n",
    "The simulated data set comprises:\n",
    "\n",
    "`room_id`: Unique identifier for each room (e.g., R001, R002).\n",
    "\n",
    "`temperature`: Current temperature reading from the sensor (in °C).\n",
    "\n",
    "`humidity`: Current humidity level reading from the sensor (in %).\n",
    "\n",
    "`timestamp`: Time when the reading was recorded (automatically generated by Spark).\n",
    "The data is generated at a rate of 5 rows per second, simulating multiple rooms with various environmental conditions.\n"

    "## Challenges\n",
    "Monitoring indoor environmental conditions poses several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**High data velocity**: Continuous data from multiple sensors can overwhelm traditional systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Need for immediate alerts**: Delays in identifying critical conditions can lead to discomfort or system inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Need for data aggregation and analysis**: Efficiently aggregating and analyzing real-time data for proactive maintenance and optimization is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apache Spark with structured streaming\n",
    "To address these challenges, Apache Spark is employed for its powerful distributed computing capabilities, enabling real-time data processing and analytics.\n"
